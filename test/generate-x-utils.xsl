        This XSLT file is included by generate-x-utils.xspec for testing
        ../src/compiler/generate-tests-utils.xsl.

        If generate-x-utils.xspec needs to define some variables or include
        other XSLT files, define or include them in this XSLT file.

        The test target (../src/compiler/generate-tests-utils.xsl) is included
        implicitly by the XSpec compiler. You don't need to include it
        explicitly. If you include it explicitly, you'll get a warning:
        "Stylesheet module ../src/compiler/generate-tests-utils.xsl is
        included or imported more than once."
